* =winny= Portage Overlay
  Just some ebuilds that aren't working elsewhere, or are not
  available elsewhere. Expect little to no testing.

  Add with:

  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
  layman -a winny
  #+END_SRC

** How to use an overlay with "little to no testing"?

   After adding the overlay with ~layman -a winny~ you should mask all
   ebuilds, and only unmask what you intend on using. I personally use
   this technique for all unofficial overlays.

*** =/etc/portage/package.mask/overlays=

    #+begin_example
    */*::winny
    #+end_example

*** =/etc/portage/package.unmask/overlays=

    #+begin_example
    net-misc/sacc::winny
    media-sound/mpvc::winny
    #+end_example

    Alternative: ~emerge -a category/name~ by default will ask if you
    would like to unmask all necessary package atoms to install
    =category/name=. Use ~dispatch-conf~ as usual ;). You may want to edit
    the resulting unmasks to not specify package atom versions.
