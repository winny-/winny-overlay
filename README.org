* =winny= Portage Overlay

[[http://unmaintained.tech/][http://unmaintained.tech/badge.svg]]

Just some ebuilds that aren't working elsewhere, or are not
available elsewhere. Expect little to no testing.

** End of Life!

This project is unmaintained and may disappear at any time.  If you want to use
ebuilds in this repository, *please copy them to your own overlay*.

*** How to use an overlay with "little to no testing"?

After adding the overlay you should mask all ebuilds, and only unmask what you
intend on using. I personally use this technique for all unofficial overlays.

**** =/etc/portage/package.mask/overlays=

#+begin_example
*/*::winny
#+end_example

**** =/etc/portage/package.unmask/overlays=

#+begin_example
net-misc/sacc::winny
media-sound/mpvc::winny
#+end_example

Alternative: ~emerge -a category/name~ by default will ask if you
would like to unmask all necessary package atoms to install
=category/name=. Use ~dispatch-conf~ as usual ;). You may want to edit
the resulting unmasks to not specify package atom versions.

*** Why is =app-emulation/spim= masked? Why subversion?

According to the [[https://devmanual.gentoo.org/ebuild-writing/functions/src_unpack/svn-sources/index.html][ebuild writing documentation on subversion
sources]]:

#+begin_quote
*Note:* Subversion ebuilds must be either with empty =KEYWORDS= or
package.masked (but not both). Empty =KEYWORDS= are strongly
preferred. This applies to "live" ebuilds (=-9999=) and to ebuilds
that extract a static revision but still use Subversion for
fetching.
#+end_quote

As the above suggests, you will need to add something like
=~app-emulation/spim-9.1.21_p729 **= to your
=package.accept_keywords=.

Subversion is used because [[https://sourceforge.net/p/spimsimulator/bugs/30/][upstream does not offer
source tarballs]], though upstream [[https://sourceforge.net/projects/spimsimulator/files/][offers prebuilt packages for Debian
x86, Debian amd64, Mac OS X, and Windows]]. This means the ebuild
must use Subversion — it's not ideal, but I can work with that.

A related point of contention is how upstream uses Subversion:
[[http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.7/svn.branchmerge.tags.html][Tags]] — the standard way to mark versions in a Subversion
repository — are not utilized; instead one must grep through the
[[https://sourceforge.net/p/spimsimulator/code/commit_browser][commit history]] looking for text that looks like a version number,
and manually check if that commit (a) corresponds to that release,
(b) references a different release, or (c) simply isn't a
reference to a release.

** Some ebuilds in this overlay

*** [[file:net-im/chatty-bin/][net-im/chatty-bin]]

Chat client for Twitch.

*** [[file:media-fonts/go][media-fonts/go]]

One of the best fonts for programming.

*** [[file:net-misc/sacc/][net-misc/sacc]]

Simple gopher client.

*** [[file:x11-misc/xbanish/][x11-misc/xbanish]]

Banish the mouse when not in use.

*** [[file:dev-scheme/racket/][dev-scheme/racket]]

I'm a big fan of Racket, so I always want the latest release.

*** [[file:games-fps/quakespasm/][games-fps/quakespasm]]

A faithful Quake I client best for single player and mods.

*** [[file:games-fps/alephone/][games-fps/alephone]]

[[file:games-fps/alephone-marathon/][Marathon]], [[file:games-fps/alephone-durandal/][Marathon 2 (Durandal)]], and [[file:games-fps/alephone-infinity/][Marathon Infinity]]. Classic
first person shooters.

*** And many more…

Ebuilds will be removed from tree as I get stuff merged back into
the original ebuild repositories.

** Tasklist

- [ ] Install =x11-wm/stumpwm-contrib='s =stumpish= script to
  =/usr/bin=. Control with useflag?
- [ ] Add missing =metadata.xml= files
- [ ] Add streamlined way to test every ebuild installs cleanly. If
  possible add to CI/CD
